What is JavaScript?
Is one of them most popular and wildly used programming languages.
You can work as a Front-end developer, back-end developer, or full-stack developer.

Whats can you do with it?
In the early days JavaScript was only used in the browsers to build interactive webpages. Back then some developers refered to JavaScript as a "toy language"
But is evolved so much, due to companies and community support, that this days we can build full web and mobile apps, real-time networking apps, comand-line tolls, even games.

Where does Javascript run?
JavaScript as original design to run only in browsers
In 2009 a enginier callad Ryan Doll took the open sourse JS code from Google Chrome V8 JvaScript engine and embeed it inside a C++ program. He called that program Node.
So Node is a C++ program that includes Google Chrome V8 JvaScript engine. With this we can run JavaScript outside the browser.
Browser and Nde provide a rutim enviroment to run JavaScript.
